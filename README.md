In this Project , I got a large amount of image data from our client. source code file contain code of each phase of image processing.   To make accurate prediction , I converted 
every images into gray images. To reduce computione i normalized each image. After i splited data into training and testing phase. For image classification I developed Convolutional
neural network with sufficient number of convolutional layer and maxpool layer with one fully connected layer.
